# Broken App Issues
Return Value Handling:
    - The results variable is an array of Promises because map is used with an async function. However, the subsequent map operation on results assumes that results is an array of resolved Promises. The correct approach is to use Promise.all to wait for all promises to resolve before proceeding.

Error Handling:
    - The error handling within the try/catch block only passes the error to the next middleware without providing any specific error handling logic.

Structure/Syntax:
    - The catch block does not define the caught error variable which is a syntax error.
    - Axios should be initalized with const to keep things consistent and because it won't be reassigned.
